# Blockchain-in-ANN-and-Quantum-Echos
classical cryptographic systems (such as RSA and ECC) face existential threats from algorithms like Shor's, which can efficiently break integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems. At the same time, the growing volume of sensitive data transmitted over networks demands quantum-resistant, tamper-proof, and intelligently verifiable
